### Storage
- Digital files stored in: `/uploads/digital_products/{vendor_id}/{product_id}/`
- Ensure directory is writable by web server
- Consider implementing CDN for large files

### Security
- Download tokens are unique and cryptographically secure
- Files cannot be accessed without valid token
- User authentication required for all downloads
- IP and user agent logged for audit trail
