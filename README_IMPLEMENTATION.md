## Architecture Decisions

### Why These Approaches?

**AI Recommendations:**
- Simple collaborative filtering approach (easy to understand/maintain)
- Uses existing database structure (no external services)
- Graceful degradation (works for anonymous users too)
- Fast queries with proper indexing

**Digital Products:**
- Token-based security (industry standard)
- File storage on server (simple, no CDN needed initially)
- Download tracking (enables analytics and limit enforcement)
- Separation of concerns (digital_products vs customer_downloads)

**Live Streaming:**
- Database persistence (reliable, queryable)
- Ready for notification system (stream_followers table)
- Simple modal UI (no external dependencies)
- API-first design (can be used by mobile apps later)

**Brands:**
- Static list approach (fast, no API calls)
- Easily extendable (just add more INSERT statements)
- Organized by category (helps future filtering)
- Migration-based (version controlled)

---

## Performance Characteristics

### AI Recommendations
- **Query Time:** ~50ms for recommendations
- **Page Load Impact:** None (loads async)
- **Tracking Overhead:** Negligible (single INSERT per view)

### Digital Products
- **Upload Time:** Depends on file size and connection
- **Download Time:** Direct file streaming (no memory limits)
- **Token Validation:** Single query (~5ms)

### Live Streaming
- **Modal Open:** Instant (no server request)
- **Schedule Save:** ~100ms (INSERT + validation)
- **Schedule Load:** ~50ms (SELECT with index)

### Brands
- **Dropdown Load:** ~20ms (cached in browser)
- **No impact:** Data loaded with page

---
