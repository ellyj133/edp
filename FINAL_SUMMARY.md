## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] MySQL database access
- [ ] Write permissions on uploads directory
- [ ] PHP 7.4+ installed
- [ ] Apache with .htaccess support

### Step-by-Step Deployment

#### 1. Run Database Migrations (REQUIRED)
```bash
cd database/migrations

# Migration 1: AI Features & Digital Products
mysql -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_DATABASE < 006_create_ai_features_tables.sql

# Migration 2: Populate Brands (130+)
mysql -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_DATABASE < 007_populate_brands.sql

# Migration 3: Live Stream Scheduling
mysql -u YOUR_USERNAME -p YOUR_DATABASE < 008_create_scheduled_streams.sql
```

#### 2. Set Directory Permissions (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Make uploads directory writable
chmod 755 uploads/digital_products

# Set ownership (replace www-data with your web server user)
chown www-data:www-data uploads/digital_products
```

#### 3. Configure PHP Settings (OPTIONAL - for large files)
Edit `php.ini` or create `.htaccess`:
```ini
upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 105M
max_execution_time = 300
```

#### 4. Clear All Caches
```bash
# Application cache
rm -rf cache/*

# Browser cache
# (Users should do Ctrl+F5)

# CDN cache (if applicable)
# Contact your CDN provider
```

#### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check database tables created
mysql -u username -p database -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE '%product_views%'"
mysql -u username -p database -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE '%digital_products%'"
mysql -u username -p database -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE '%scheduled_streams%'"

# Check brand count
mysql -u username -p database -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM brands"
# Should return 130+

# Check file permissions
ls -la uploads/digital_products
# Should show drwxr-xr-x
```

## 🔒 Security Validation

### Implemented Security Measures
- ✅ CSRF tokens on all forms
- ✅ Prepared SQL statements (no SQL injection)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Token-based file downloads
- ✅ .htaccess file protection
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ Download tracking (IP + user agent)

### Security Testing
```bash
# Test 1: Direct file access (should fail)
curl http://your-site.com/uploads/digital_products/1/1/file.pdf
# Expected: 403 Forbidden

# Test 2: Invalid download token (should fail)
curl http://your-site.com/download.php?token=invalid123
# Expected: 404 Not Found or Unauthorized

# Test 3: SQL injection attempt
# Try entering: ' OR '1'='1 in any form field
# Expected: Safely escaped, no error
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance
| Feature | Response Time |
|---------|---------------|
| AI Recommendations | < 100ms |
| View Tracking | < 10ms (async) |
| Schedule Stream | < 150ms |
| Digital File Upload | Depends on file size |
| Download Token Validation | < 50ms |
| Brand Dropdown Load | < 20ms (cached) |

### Database Indexes
All critical queries have indexes:
- `user_product_views`: user_id, product_id, session_id
- `digital_products`: product_id
- `customer_downloads`: user_id, order_id, download_token
- `scheduled_streams`: vendor_id, scheduled_start

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem:** AI recommendations not showing
```bash
# Check 1: Verify API is accessible
curl http://your-site.com/api/ai-recommendations.php?product_id=1

# Check 2: Check database table exists
mysql -u user -p -e "SHOW TABLES LIKE 'user_product_views'"

# Check 3: Browser console for errors
# Open browser DevTools → Console tab
```

**Problem:** Digital file upload fails
```bash
# Check 1: Directory permissions
ls -la uploads/digital_products
# Should show: drwxr-xr-x

# Check 2: PHP upload limit
php -i | grep upload_max_filesize

# Check 3: Disk space
df -h
```

**Problem:** Schedule modal doesn't open
```bash
# Check 1: JavaScript errors
# Browser DevTools → Console

# Check 2: Clear cache
# Ctrl+Shift+Delete in browser

# Check 3: Verify file loaded
# View source, search for "scheduleEvent"
```

**Problem:** Brands dropdown empty
```bash
# Check 1: Run migration
mysql -u user -p database < 007_populate_brands.sql

# Check 2: Verify brands exist
mysql -u user -p -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM brands WHERE is_active=1"
# Should return 130+

# Check 3: Check database connection
# Review error logs
```

FROM user_product_views 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at) 
ORDER BY date DESC 
LIMIT 7;

-- Check digital product uploads
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_files, 
       SUM(file_size) as total_size_bytes
FROM digital_products;

-- Check scheduled streams
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM scheduled_streams 
GROUP BY status;
```
